            <h3> Who We Are </h3>
            <p>
                Cook's Cookies is a small, family-owned, community-driven 
                bakery committed to delivering the perfect cookie every time. 
                <br/>
                Founded in 2015 in Boston, the family at Cook's is still 
                growing. (just like the appetites of our customers!) <br/>
                At Cook's, we value our community. You can find us every Sunday 
                hosting bake sales for our charity of the month, <br/>
                or volunteering at the local food shelters. We know every hand 
                makes a difference, so we offer all of ours! <br/>
                We hope you become part of the family soon!
            </p>
